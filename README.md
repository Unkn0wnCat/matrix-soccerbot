# matrix-soccerbot (WIP)

This is a bot for posting summaries of soccer games to Matrix-Chatrooms.

The bot is still heavily work-in-progress. It can currently only post a hard-coded game's summary to one specific room.

## Configuration

Upon first run the bot will create its config file in its working directory called `config.yaml`.

## TODO

* [ ] Make bot automatically load current game from specified league
* [ ] Make bot create one message per game and update it from then on
* [ ] Make bot be configurable from in chat
